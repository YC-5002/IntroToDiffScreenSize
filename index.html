    <!--I added the heading, paragraph and components needed and then I worked on the css. I first added @media screen with a max width of 600 px and made the body's background color turn lightyellow when the screen width is less than or equal to that. I added another code where @media screen with a min width of 601px meaning that if the screen size is equal to or more than 601px, it would turn the body background color to lightblue. The conditions, being the part after the and, set the conditions for the appearance of the screen. It checks which condition is being fulfilled by the screen size and applies the corresponding style.-->
